# Enhanced Lead Miner Filtering System

## Overview

The Lead Miner system has been enhanced with sophisticated business model detection to eliminate false positives like WinspireMe and other B2B service providers. The new system focuses on identifying **actual nonprofits offering travel packages for fundraising**, not companies that sell services to nonprofits.

## Key Improvements

### 1. Business Model Classification

The classifier now categorizes organizations into four types:
- **`nonprofit`**: Target organizations (schools, charities, foundations)
- **`b2b_service`**: Service providers selling to nonprofits (excluded)
- **`vendor`**: Commercial vendors and suppliers (excluded)
- **`unknown`**: Unclear business model (flagged for review)

### 2. Enhanced Exclusion Patterns

#### B2B Service Provider Exclusions
- **Service Language**: "we provide", "our services", "contact for quote"
- **Pricing Indicators**: "starting at $", "packages available", "call to book"
- **Business Terms**: "vendor", "supplier", "agency", "consultation"
- **Known Platforms**: WinspireMe, BiddingForGood, CharityBuzz, etc.

#### Political & Government Exclusions
- **Political**: "campaign", "PAC", "political action committee"
- **Government**: "municipal", "federal", "state agency", "department of"

#### For-Profit Exclusions
- **Corporate Structure**: "corporation", "LLC", "Inc.", "shareholders"

### 3. Target Organization Prioritization

#### Educational Institutions (Highest Priority)
- Schools, universities, colleges
- PTAs, alumni associations
- Student organizations
- **Boost**: +10% confidence score

#### Religious Organizations (Reduced Priority)
- Churches, temples, synagogues
- Parishes, dioceses, ministries
- **Reduction**: -10% confidence score (but not excluded)

### 4. Enhanced Search Strategy

#### Improved Query Terms
```
Educational Focus:
- "school travel auction" "fundraiser"
- "university travel raffle" "donate"
- "PTA travel packages" "fundraising"

Nonprofit Focus:
- "nonprofit travel packages" "donate"
- "charity vacation auction" "support our"
- "travel packages fundraiser" "501c3"
```

#### Comprehensive Exclusions
```

-site:winspire.com -site:biddingforgood.com -site:charitybuzz.com

Service Language:
-"we provide" -"our services" -"contact for quote"

Political/Government:

- **Confidence Tracking**: Monitor classification accuracy over time

### 3. Quality Metrics
- **Target Rate**: >70% of results should be nonprofits
- **B2B Exclusion Rate**: <30% should be B2B services
- **Verification Rate**: >70% of nonprofits should verify as legitimate

## Testing Results

Run the test script to see the filtering in action:

```bash
npx ts-node test-enhanced-filtering.ts
```

- **Focuses on actual nonprofit customers**
- **Prioritizes educational institutions**

### 2. Quality Assurance
- **Multi-layer validation system**
- **Automatic false positive detection**
- **Human review for edge cases**

### 3. Scalable Monitoring

## Usage Instructions

### 1. Run Enhanced Classification
```typescript
import { ClassifierAgent } from './src/agents/classifier-agent';

const classifier = new ClassifierAgent();
const result = await classifier.classifyContent(scrapedContent);

// Check business model
if (result.businessModel === 'b2b_service') {
  console.log('Excluded: B2B service provider');
}
```

### 2. Monitor Results
```typescript
import { monitoringSystem } from './src/utils/monitoring';

const report = monitoringSystem.analyzeClassificationResults(results);
console.log(`B2B Excluded: ${report.excludedB2BCount}`);
```

### 3. Generate Review Dashboard
```typescript
import { reviewDashboard } from './src/utils/review-dashboard';

const dashboardFile = await reviewDashboard.saveDashboard(results);
// Open dashboardFile in browser for visual review
```

## Next Steps

1. **Deploy Enhanced System**: Replace existing classifier with enhanced version
2. **Monitor Performance**: Track false positive reduction
3. **Refine Patterns**: Adjust exclusion patterns based on results
4. **Expand Verification**: Integrate with IRS/GuideStar APIs for validation
